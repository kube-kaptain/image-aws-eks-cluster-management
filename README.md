# AWS EKS Cluster Management

A comprehensive set of tools for managing EKS clusters on AWS.

For the full list of available commands see the [Command Reference](CommandReference.md).

For why this toolkit is the best approach for managing EKS on AWS and why
Terraform, OpenTofu and other declarative tools are usually the wrong choice,
see [Why Not Terraform?](WhyNotTerraform.md).


## Image Contents

Based on Debian Trixie, we also install:

- **eksctl**     - EKS control plane, node group, and addon operations.
- **kubectl**    - Kubernetes API interactions eg cordon, drain and more.
- **AWS CLI v2** - Kube credentials and Utility in case of emergencies.
- **age**        - Decryption of secrets if included in the image.


## Multi-Architecture

Built for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` for your ease of use.


## Usage

To use this image the best approach is to use a Kaptain build process. Right
now only GitHub Actions workflows are available, so below is a link to the
example file for the correct workflow for using this image.

## Use Patterns

This image can be used for creation deletion and maintenance but the former two
are not done frequently (eg DR practice runs or when new). On the contrary the
normal use of this image is for 4 monthly (minimum) maintenance cycles, or more
often for addon upgrades or node group patching runs.


### Normal Maintenance

A normal maintenance run looks like this:

1. Ensure all components in the cluster are compatible with the target version
2. Run `cluster validate-image` to ensure it's viable
3. Run `cluster setup-credentials` to make the commands work
4. Run `cluster list all` to get the lay of the land
5. Run `cluster list insights` to review any advisories and decide whether to proceed
6. If more detail is needed run `cluster describe insight <ID>` for each
7. Run `cluster upgrade addons` to get the addons up to date as a base line
8. Run `cluster upgrade controlplane` to upgrade the control plane version
9. Run `cluster upgrade addons` to bring the addons into line with the control plane
10. Run `cluster create nodegroups` to create new nodegroup(s) to migrate workloads onto
11. Run `cluster locksize old-nodegroups` to prevent autoscaler scaling old nodegroups
12. Run `cluster cordon old-nodegroups` to prevent workloads starting up on them
13. Delete a low-impact pod and ensure it starts up fine on the new nodegroup(s)
14. Gently and thoughtfully migrate any singletons or other sensitive workloads
15. Run `cluster drain old-nodegroups` to migrate any remaining workloads
16. Confirm everything you care about is running and working fine
17. Run `cluster delete old-nodegroups` to remove the empty unused nodes
18. Run `cluster upgrade yaml-reconciliation` to ensure cluster matches cluster.yaml
    WARNING: ensure toggling auto mode won't disrupt your workloads before running
19. Upgrade other components within the cluster to match

Or if your workloads are resilient (multiple replicas, PDBs, all three probes,
termination grace period, graceful shutdown) you can run the automated version:

Full-auto: `cluster upgrade fast-end-to-end-automatic`

However clusters with 100% perfectly configured workloads are rarer than hen's
teeth. If you do this with singletons or misconfigured workloads you'll probably
experience outages during this process; take the slower route, instead.


### Cluster Creation

To create a new cluster just:

1. Run `cluster validate-image` to ensure it's viable
2. Run `cluster setup-credentials` to make the commands work
3. Run `cluster create cluster --dry-run` and ensure it looks good and as expected
4. Run `cluster create cluster` and ensure it creates smoothly and without errors
5. Run `cluster list all` to see what you created
6. Bootstrap/seed the cluster with tooling and workloads - easy if kaptain


### Cluster Deletion

To delete a cluster for DR testing or other reasons, just:

1. Run `cluster validate-image` to ensure it's viable
2. Run `cluster setup-credentials` to make the commands work
3. Run `cluster delete cluster` and type in the requested values to confirm
4. Run `cluster list all` to ensure there's nothing left
5. Clean up any external resources that the cluster was managing eg DNS/LBs
6. Cry if you got it wrong, party if you got it right :-D
